# AvalanchePredict
This is my Data Practicum II final project for Regis University!

There are a few different files available for analysis, and their descriptions are below:
1) EDA-Report.html - this file will showcase a generated exploratory data analysis interactive report for my project, highlighting some key points on the input variables
2) Avalanche-Predict-Blog-Post.html - this file can be downloaded & opened in Chrome and will go through my entire machine learning workflow for this avalanche prediction project
3) Avalanche-Predict-Blog-Post.rmd - this is the raw R source code to build the interactive blog for those that want to learn more about flexdashboard package
4) Final-Data-Practicum-II-Presentation.pptx - this is my final audio-recorded project presentation showcasing a few critical steps and highlighting my final results and project reflections
5) Input-Data.zip - here you can grab the csv files & r data if you want to play around with the snow, wind, weather, and avalanche merged data

Hope everyone enjoys this project and let me know if you have any problems with the files or data!
